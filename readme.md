Rekt
====

Rekt is a compiler for simple lisp-based language written in C.

### Usage

Rekt is eagerly evaluated, mutable, and dynamically typed dialect of scheme
using JVM as the back-end.

Rekt has the following semantic features:
* `define` for defining variables
* `set` for mutating existing variables
* `fun` for defining functions with arguments
* `if` for conditionals (if-then-else)
* `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` for basic arithmetic
* `==`, `/=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<` expressions as relational operators
